# Walmart Sales Data EDA

## Introduction

Welcome to the Walmart Sales Data Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project! This project aims to showcase my SQL skills through a comprehensive analysis of Walmart's sales data. The dataset, obtained from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition, includes information on various attributes such as branch, city, customer type, gender, product line, unit price, quantity, VAT, total sales, date, time, payment method, cost of goods sold (COGS), gross margin percentage, gross income, and customer ratings.

## Project Overview

The project consists of three main sections: General Overview, Feature Engineering, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The SQL queries cover a range of questions, helping to uncover insights into Walmart's sales patterns and customer behavior.

## SQL Queries

### General Overview

- Displaying the entire dataset for a general overview.
  
### Feature Engineering

- Creating a time of day column to categorize sales transactions.
- Creating columns for day of the week and month name.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Questions

#### Customer Behavior

- Identifying different cities in the dataset.
- Exploring the relationship between product lines and gender.
- Analyzing customer ratings based on time of day, day of the week, and branch.
- Evaluating the impact of payment methods on the average transaction value.
  

#### Sales Performance

- Determining the most common payment method.
- Analyzing the best-selling product lines.
- Calculating total revenue per month.
- Identifying the city with the highest revenue.
  

### Business Insights

- Understanding peak sales hours during the day.
- Analyzing the relationship between customer type and revenue.
- Examining the impact of VAT on different product lines.
  

## Conclusion

The Walmart Sales Data EDA project provides valuable insights into customer behavior, sales performance, and business trends. The SQL queries applied demonstrate my ability to extract meaningful information from  datasets, contributing to informed decision-making.
